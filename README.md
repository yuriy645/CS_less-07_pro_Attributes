## My homework for the C# Professional course, less-07_pro_Attributes
1. Create a custom AccessLevelAttribute to define
    level of user access to the system. Form the composition of employees of a certain company
    as a set of classes, for example, Manager, Programmer, Director. Using the attribute
    AccessLevelAttribute allocate personnel access levels and display
    reaction of the system to each employee's attempt to gain access to the protected section.
2. Create a class and apply the Obsolete attribute to its methods first in the form, simply
    outputting a warning, and then in a form that prevents compilation.
    Demonstrate how the attribute works by calling these methods as an example.
3. Expand the capabilities of the reflector program from the previous lesson as follows:
      1. Add the ability to choose which members of the type should be shown
         user. At the same time, it should be possible to select several members at once
         type, such as methods and properties.
     2. Add the ability to display information about attributes for types and all members of the type,
         which can be decorated with attributes.
